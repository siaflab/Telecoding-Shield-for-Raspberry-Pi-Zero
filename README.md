# Telecoding-Shield-for-Raspberry-Pi-Zero
Telecoding Shield for Raspberry Pi Zero is a module that can mount 920 MHz band LoRa module, OSD and DAC chip.
Power supply to Raspberry Pi Zero can also be done from this shield in the range of 5V to 14V.
If you change the grade of the DC - DC converter, such as changing from Murata's "OKL-T/3-W12N-C" to "OKL-T/6-W12N-C", 
you can select the current value required for your system. The current can be supplied up to 6 A, it is possible to operate rasberry pi 3.
